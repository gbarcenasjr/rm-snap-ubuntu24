# rm-snap-ubuntu24.sh Project Script ver. 1.1

## Remove Snap from Ubuntu for good

This script aims to remove Snap, Snap Store, and Snap Packages from your Ubuntu 24.04 environment. This script also prevents Snap from reinstalling in the future and uses GNOME Software Store as an alternative GUI App store.

Regardless of Snap's controversies, I simply prefer other packaging formats like deb packages. Snap just boots so slow, especially the first time you try an app! So, to save me and any other Ubuntu 24 user the hassle of manually removing Snap, Snap Store and Snap Packages, I create this script.
